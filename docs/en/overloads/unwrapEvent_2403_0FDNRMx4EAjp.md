# Description
Unwraps the `input` event, outputting its payload.

> This is useful when outputting _containers_ (lists, maps or sets of values), and you want to track when an item in such a container changes. See [wrap](/refman/overloads/wrapEvent_2400_0FDO0TRxwxbF) to wrap a value into an _event_.
