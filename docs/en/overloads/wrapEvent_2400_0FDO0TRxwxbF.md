# Description
Pack the `input` as an event that can be passed as a value.

> This is useful when outputting _containers_ (lists, maps or sets of values), and you want to track when an item in such a container changes. Just _pack_ the value as an _event_ (a `time-stamp, payload-value` pair), and pass down the event.
